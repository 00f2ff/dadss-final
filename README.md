This code was developed as part of a Decision Analysis and Decision Support Systems (DADSS) Spring 2015 project at Carnegie Mellon University. Our Excel model had too many variables to simulate easily in Excel (and Excel is slow when it comes to calculating anything complicated), so we wrote this code as a simulator.
